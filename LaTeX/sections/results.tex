-what did we achieve?\\
 *managing scv units harvesting and building using Markov chains\\
 *system for buildings to train units using Markov chains

-have we any way of evaluating our performance?\\
 *number of units and buildings completed after n-minutes?\\
 *needs to be somehow combined with a full strategy for proper evaluation (more in conclusion)..
