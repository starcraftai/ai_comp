%conclusions
-what do we think about the results?

-Difficulty in testing performance
 *evaluating building and resource gathering not straight forward\\
 *what is an optimal result of this process (speed in building attack units?)\\
 *how to test against other systems\\

-Needs integration with a full strategy to yield good results\\
 *would need testing against a multitude of bots to avoid over-training\\
 *different attack strategies could benefit from different Markov chains - would need to train for specific strategies.\\

%Future Work
Future work -other forms of learning algorithms?


-genetic algorithms\\
 + handle a multitude of different variables\\
 + could keep \textit{dna} binary strings separate for different agents and have agent specific genetic functions\\
 - would require many iterations to yield good results\\
 - performance metric operator still an issue
