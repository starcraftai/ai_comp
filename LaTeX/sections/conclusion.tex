-Difficulty in testing performance
 *evaluating building and resource gathering not straight forward
 *what is an optimal result of this process (speed in building attack units?)
 *how to test against other systems

 Future work - better evaluation techniques

-what do we think about the results?

-Patrick might write about future work using genetic algorithms?

-other forms of learning algorithms?
