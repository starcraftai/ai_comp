StarCraft is a \textit{real time strategy} game developed by \textit{Blizzard} and released in 1998. In the game, the player gathers and manages resources, constructs a base, builds an army and attempts to destroy all enemy players.  

In the game's multiplayer and single-match skirmish modes, the player can be controlled by a computer agent using the \textit{Brood War API (BWAPI)}. A yearly AI competition for the game, the SSCAI, has been running since 2011 where students submit their own bots to compete in a tournement.

Many acedemic papers have been written exploring the use of different AI techniques for different components of the game. Our AI will use Markov chains to manage the resource gathering, base construction and unit building.
