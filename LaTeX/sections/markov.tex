Markov chains are similar to state machines, the difference being that their transitions are governed by some random process. 

Agents can be controlled using these systems similar to how they would be controlled by a state machine. To make an agents actions meaningful, some sort of performance metric needs to be created for the agent. The values which dictate the random process which governs state transitions is then tweaked to maximize the performance value.

By applying Markov chains to unit/building construction and managing resource gathering in StarCraft we hope to be able to optimise this component of the game.
