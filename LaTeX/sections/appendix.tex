\section{Individual Contribution}

At the beginning Jeremiah and Patrick did background research on existing bots for StarCraft and looked at existing research papers. Giovanni having knowledge of the game worked on figuring out how we could feed information about the game world back into our agents. 

After deciding on using Markov Chains, as a group, we discussed how to implement them. Jeremiah formalised these and wrote about them in the report. Giovanni worked implementing his mathematical model of how resources and unit slots would feed back into the Markov chain and wrote about it in the report. Patrick began writing an implementation of the agent and state machines. Giovanni and Jeremiah wrote code for the different states.

Together we went through the conclusions and results sections in the report.
