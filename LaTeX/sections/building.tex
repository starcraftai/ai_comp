\subsection{Unit Construction Structures}


Figure~\ref{fig:scv_diagram} shows the Markov Chain which dictates the behaviour of unit constructing structures. The unlabelled actions represent the change state change from building a unit to being idle which the player has no control over. The probabilities \(P_{I}\) and \(P_{B}\) refer to the probability that an idle structure remains idle or builds a unit. \(P_{UX}\) refers to the probability of the structure building unit \(X\).
