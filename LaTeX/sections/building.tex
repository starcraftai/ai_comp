\subsection{Unit Construction Structures}


Figure~\ref{fig:struct_units} shows the Markov Chain which dictates the behaviour of unit constructing structures. The unlabelled actions represent the change state change from building a unit to being idle which the player has no control over. The probabilities \(P_{I}\) and \(P_{B}\) refer to the probability that an idle structure remains idle or builds a unit. \(P_{UX}\) refers to the probability of the structure building unit \(X\).

\subsection{Research Orientated Structures}

Figure~\ref{fig:struct_research} shows a the Markov chain for research oriented structures. The states are in a chain with one direction of flow showing the next available research stage. There are probabilities for continuing research, \(P_{R1}, P_{R2}, \ldots, P_{RN}\), and probabilities to remain idle \(P_{I1}, \ldots, P_{I(N-1)}\).
